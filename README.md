# keyid

Uses the Camelot system to either:

- suggest the next track (based on your current Master deck)
  - Rekordbox takes 60 seconds (by default) to add the Master deck track to your history. See [here](https://assets-global.website-files.com/624b7d52289aa4ed9d117a25/6395995aaa7b424b012bfea7_Screen%20Shot%202022-12-11%20at%2012.47.54%20AM.png) for how to change this setting
- generate a new playlist from the given playlist name (or your whole collection) with the selections in a compatible key and tempo.

This assumes you have analyzed your collection using the Alphanumeric key notation.

# Why

- Q: Rekordbox already has a "Traffic Light" system that can suggest tracks to play that are in key, why do this?
- A: It sucks, and this program has a better set of rules that finds stuff that works more harmonically.

# Prerequisites

- Install [rekordbox](https://rekordbox.com/en/)
- Set the key display format to [Alphanumeric](https://support.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/articles/8943219092761-Can-I-change-the-display-format-for-keys)
- Analyze your tracks. I recommend using [Mixed In Key](https://mixedinkey.com/integration/rekordbox-integration/) (other key detection software makes this program mostly useless because they're almost always wrong)

# Usage

```
Usage of ./keyid:
  -debug
        Enable debug logging
  -mode string
        One of 'suggest' or 'generate' (default "suggest")
  -playlist string
        Name of Rekordbox Playlist to use (uses whole collection by default)
  -startWith string
        Some part of the Track Title to start with in 'generate' mode (otherwise
        starts with first track in provided 'playlist')
```

## Examples

- To suggest the next track based on what you're currently playing (lists all compatible tracks from your collection):

```
./keyid
```

- To use an existing playlist for the pool of tracks to find:

```
./keyid -playlist 'My Cool Playlist 2024'
```

- To generate a new playlist based on your whole collection (also accepts `-playlist`):

```
./keyid -mode generate -playlist 'My Cool Playlist 2024' -startWith 'Cafe Del Mar'
```

- NOTE: You must provide a track to start with from your source playlist.

# Roadmap

- Multiplatform downloadable builds
- Generate .m3u playlists in `generate` mode
- Better documentation
