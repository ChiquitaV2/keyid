# keyid

Uses the Camelot system to either:

- suggest the next track (based on your current Master deck)
  - Rekordbox takes 60 seconds (by default) to add the Master deck track to your history
- generate a new playlist from the given playlist name (or your whole collection) with the selections in a compatible key and tempo.

This assumes you have analyzed your collection using the Alphanumeric key notation.
